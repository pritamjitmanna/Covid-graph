# Covid-graph
This a simple graph on the covid cases in india with only new cases, recoveries and deaths

The Coronavirus is ravaging all over the world. In India, every day thousands of lives are lost and lakhs of cases are coming out.
On the brighter note, the recovery rate is also on the higher side.

I tried to create a simple bar graph of the new cases, recoveries and deaths with the data required from a API. 
I will try to add other statistics and some design too..!ðŸ˜…

You can change the graph to recoveries, deaths or 
new cases with the select portion in the top right corner

You are able to hover over the bars to see the cases/recoveries/deaths at your wish
